Antenna
-------

wave (radiation) propagates in all directions and normally follows a sine curve.

one complete cycle of the wave is defined as one wave length.

The wavelength of the radiation can be related to the antenna that produces it.

A simple dipole is an antenna that accomodates half the wavelength of a radiation wave.

when such antenna is fed with a signal, a concentration of electrons is formed around the antenna.

these electrons migrates to one end of the antenna, then fills up the entire antenna as they
migrate to the form a maximum concentration on the other end. 

This process repeats with the frequency of the signal, hence producing a fluctuating magnetic field.
The magnetic field reverses its direction as the electrons migrates from one end of the antenna to 
the other.

The magnectic field strength is maximum when the electrons are evenly distributed along the antenna as they 
migrate from one end to the another. This maximum field strength is proportional to amplitude of the wave.
This magnectic field is also called the H-field.





Frequency 
+ low frequency travels farther (ex. Bass sound )
+ high frequency means more speed.
+ higher frequency -> smaller wavelength
+ Small frequency -> higher wavelength



Amplitude
+ Same as the power of the wave measured in milliwatts(mW) or decibel (dBm - decibel to milliwatt)
+ 0dBm = 1mW

-------------------
+ -3  : 1/2 (half) the original power
+ +3  : 2x     the original power
+ -10 : 1/10th the original power
+ +10 : 10x    the original power
