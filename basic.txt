voltage source
===============
a perfect voltage source is like a black box with two terminals which ensures that the voltage drop
- across its terminals does not change (remains fixed).
+ In reality every voltage source has a small resistance in series but must maintain a maximum
- current regardless (I = V/R)
+ a voltage source likes an open-circuit load but hates a short-circuit load.
+ example: battery.


===============
current  source
===============
a perfect current source is like a black box with two terminals which ensures that there is 
constant current maintain through the external circuit connected to it regardless of the load
(resistance) or voltage applied.
+ For this to be achieved, it must be able to supply any necessary voltage accross its terminal.
+ In reality, there is a limit to the amount of voltage they can provide in order for it to 
- a constant current supply.
+ a current sources likes a short-circuit load and hates an open-circuit load.


===========================
thevenin/norton equivalent circuit
===========================
any complex network of resistors and voltage sources is similar to a single resistor in series
with a single voltage source. - thevenin
+ the single voltage is called thevenin voltage (Vth) - open circuit at load terminal
+ the single resistance is called thevenin resistance (Rth) - short circuit across voltage sources.

thevenin voltage 
================

    ---    -------
    Vin    r1 + r2

    vth = (10/(10+10)) * 30 = 15V 

thevenin resistance
===================
assumes that there is a short across all voltage sources, then the circuit is reduced to 
two resistors in parallel and then we find their equivalence.

Rth = r1 * r2    
      -------
      r1 + r2

Rth = (10 * 10) / (10 + 10) = 5kOhms.

The new equivalent thevenin circuit for the above voltage divider circuit is as shown below
with the single resistor and single voltage connected in series.

+ The load resistance should be far greater than the internal resistance of the voltage supply.
- (Rload >> Rinternal)
- this is required to avoid significant drop in the output voltage. (low attenuating effect)
+ To minimize the attenuation of a signal source below its open-circuit voltage, keep the load
- resistance large compared with the output resistance.

+ power transfer is maximum when the source resitance equals load resistance.
+ note that the source resistance is same as the thevenin resistance.

zener diodes 
============
this device is used to create a constant voltage inside a circuit somewhere by providing them with
a current derived fro a higher voltage within the circuit.

signals
=======
these are voltages that change in time in a particular way

sinusodal signals
=================
eqn1:  v= Asin2TTftV
       A = amplitude
       TT = 3.142
       f = frequency (hertz)
       t = time.

eqn2:  v= Asin(2TTft + ö )
       ö = phase

eqn3:  v= Asin(wt)
       w = angular frequency(radians/sec). = 2TTf

it is standard practice to describe the circuit behaviour by its frequency response.
a linear circuit driven by a sinewave will always respond with a sinewave, although the phase and
- amplitude are changed.

amplitude (pp) peak to peak : twice the amplitude. (2a)

       \   /       |
         .         -

amplitude (rms) root mean square (a/(2^(0.5))) = (0.707a);

example: the power outlet in USA is 120volts rms (170volts amplitude), (339volts peak to peak)


relative signal amplitude
+ two signals are compared (power and amplitude) relatively by using decibel
eqn1 : dB = 10 * log10 (p2/p1)
       + p = power 

eqn2 : dB = 20 * log10 (a2/a1)
       + a = amplitude 


ramp signals p.49
============
it is a signal type where the voltage rises at a constant rate.
This can go on forever, therefore it is usually limited (finite time) or periodic. the periodic ramp 
are called sawtooth.

noise signals p.49

square signal
=============
The signal has its peak and rms amplitude (voltage) to be the same.

Note:
+ In reality, the edges are not perfectly squared as shown. therefore it is important to compute
- the rise time (tr) or fall time. 
+ The rise time is the amount of time it takes for a signal to rise from 10% to 90% of its total
- transition. 


pulse signal
============
this signal type is defined by amplitude and pulse width. they can be generated periodically, 
therefore defined by frequency, or pulse repitiion rate or duty cycle.
duty cycle: the ratio of pulse width to the repetition period. (0 - 100%)
pulse signal can be positive or negative.

=======================
steps and spike signals
=======================
This signal type provides a way to describe what happens in a circuit.
the step function is a part of a square wave.
the spike is a jump of vanishingly short duration.

==============
signal sources
==============
this comes in 3 types like signal generators, pulse generators and function generators.

signal generators:
-----------------
this type of signal source are sinewave oscillators equipped to give a wide range of frequency coverage
with provision to control the amplitude (using attenuators). Therefore, the allow for amplitude and
frequency modulation (sweep generator, synthesizers). 
+ Ideal for testing circuits with varying frequency properties (tuned circuits or filters)
+ most signal generator uses a frequency synthesizer as the signal source.


pulse generators:
-----------------
they generate pulses with various setable configuration like its repitition rate and pulse width.


function generators:
-------------------
These are the most flexible signal source as they are capable of producing sine, triangle and 
square wave over wide frequency range with controlled amplitude and dc offset 
+ Note that a dc offset is a constant dc voltage added to the signal.

==============
1.4 capacitors
==============
this is a passive linear device.
+ It is used for waveform generation, filtering, blocking and bypass application.
+ It is used for differentiation and integration.
+ it is a device with a pair of metal plates seperated by some insulating materials.
+ it is sometimes called a frequency dependent resistor which can be used to make 
--  frequency dependent voltage divider (bypass, coupling)

+ it voltage and current are 90degree out of phase.

+ it stores charges (q) on both plates with opposite magnitude
q = cv 
q : amount of charge 
v : voltage across the capacitor 
c : 8.85x10e-14 x eA/d F
    + e: dielectric constant of the insulator.
    + A: area of the plates
    + d: distance between the plates.

i = c x dV = -V
        --   ---
        dt    R
i = current through the capacitor 
c = capacitance of the capacitor 
dv = voltage change due to current flow over time. 
dt = change in time.
: This equation implies that the current is only proportional to the rate of change of 
+ voltage over time.


u = 0.5 x cv^2
u : energy in joules 
c : capacitance of the capacitor 
v = voltage across the capacitor

coupling - pg.52
---------------------------
a capacitor looks like an open circuit in dc.
a blocking capacitor is also known as a coupling capacitor because it couple a varying
signal while blocking its average dc level.

                    +-----------+

bypass - pg.52
----------------
a capacitor looks like a short circuit in high frequency( no time for it to charge up)
it suppresses (bypass) signals where you do not want them by redirecting them to ground.
At high frequency, the voltage changes very quickly, so the capacitor doesn’t have time to fully
charge.
Instead, it keeps passing the changing current easily—almost like a wire (a short circuit)
therefore, redirecting the high frequency signal away from the circuit where they are not
desired to ground. Hence, the name decoupling or bypass capacitor.

                    +-----------+

capacitor in parallel 
-----------------------
This is combined to appear like one big mighty capacitor.

     +---------+---------+
     |         |         |
    ---       ---       ---
 c1 ---    c2 ---    c3 ---
     |         |         |
     +---------+---------+

c_total x V = q_total = q1   + q2   + q3   +...
                      = c1.V + c2.V + c3.V + ...
                      = (c1 + c2 + c3 + ...) x V
c_total = (c1 + c2 + c3 + ...)

This appears to be the opposite of resistors in series.
