| Volt |
+------+
It is an electromotive force EMF between two points required to cause one 
ampere of current to do one joule (measure of energy) of work in flowing 
between the points. Voltage can also be expressed as joules per coulomb.
Vab = Uab/q = (Ub-Ua)/dq = (joules/coulomb) = energy
1v = 1j/1c

| POWER |
+-------+
This represents how much energy per second goes into powering a ciruit.
power, p = dW/dt. (W = v*q)
p = dW/dt = v * dq/dt (dq/dt = I)
P = VI. (j/s = Watt = VA)
P = VI = (1.5V)(0.1A) = 0.15W
P = VI = IR * I = V * V/R

| RESISTANCE - ELECTRIC |
+-----------------------+
The ratio of applied voltage to the resultant current flow 
1. R = V/I
   1 ohm = 1V/1A

2. R = pL/A (resistivity x wire Length / wire cross section area)
   p = RA/L (resitivity) (ohmM)

3. G = 1/p  (conductivity -> The inverse of resitivity) (1/ohmM)
   V = IR = I * pL/A = I * L/(GA)

4. Resistivity is temperature dependent and varies based on material
   p = p0[1 + a(T-T0)]
   p  -> caluculated resistivity
   p0 -> set reference resistivity
   a  -> temperature coefficient of resistivity (1/Celscius)
   T0 -> Set reference temperature
   T  -> target temperature

The resisitivity of most metals increases with temperature because
thermal energy causes atomic vibration which reduces the drift
velocity of conducting electrons.

Thermal Resistance and conductivity
Tr = L/(kA)  = yL/A 
Ph = dQ/dt = k(A/L)dT = (A/L * 1/y)dT = dT/Tr

Tr : Thermal Resistance
L  : length
A  : surface area 
y  : thermal resistivity  (mC/W)
k  : thermal conductivity (W/mC)
dQ : heat difference over time
dT : Temperature difference (C)
Ph : Power as heat (W)
