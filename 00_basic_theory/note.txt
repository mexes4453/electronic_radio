| Volt |
+------+
It is an electromotive force EMF between two points required to cause one 
ampere of current to do one joule (measure of energy) of work in flowing 
between the points. Voltage can also be expressed as joules per coulomb.
Vab = Uab/q = (Ub-Ua)/dq = (joules/coulomb) = energy
1v = 1j/1c

| POWER |
+-------+
This represents how much energy per second goes into powering a ciruit.
power, p = dW/dt. (W = v*q)
p = dW/dt = v * dq/dt (dq/dt = I)
P = VI. (j/s = Watt = VA)
P = VI = (1.5V)(0.1A) = 0.15W
P = VI = IR * I = V * V/R


+-----------------------+
| RESISTANCE - ELECTRIC |
+-----------------------+
The ratio of applied voltage to the resultant current flow 
1. R = V/I
   1 ohm = 1V/1A

2. R = pL/A (resistivity x wire Length / wire cross section area)
   p = RA/L (resitivity) (ohmM)

3. G = 1/p  (conductivity -> The inverse of resitivity) (1/ohmM)
   V = IR = I * pL/A = I * L/(GA)

4. Resistivity is temperature dependent and varies based on material
   p = p0[1 + a(T-T0)]
   p  -> caluculated resistivity
   p0 -> set reference resistivity
   a  -> temperature coefficient of resistivity (1/Celscius)
   T0 -> Set reference temperature
   T  -> target temperature

The resisitivity of most metals increases with temperature because
thermal energy causes atomic vibration which reduces the drift
velocity of conducting electrons.

+----------------------+
| RESISTANCE - THERMAL |
+----------------------+
Thermal Resistance and conductivity
Tr = L/(kA)  = yL/A 
Ph = dQ/dt = k(A/L)dT = (A/L * 1/y)dT = dT/Tr

Tr : Thermal Resistance
L  : length
A  : surface area 
y  : thermal resistivity  (mC/W)
k  : thermal conductivity (W/mC)
dQ : heat difference over time
dT : Temperature difference (C)
Ph : Power as heat (W)

| CIRCUITS |
+----------+
Circuit is any arrangement of electronic components with a voltage source which drives
current within it.
They are classified as basic, series and parallel circuit.
A circuit can be a combination of both series and parallel arrangement.
         |  SERIES |  PARALLEL  | 
---------+---------+------------
Current  | same    |   divided  |
Voltage  | divided |   same     |


+----------+
| RESISTOR |
+----------+
Device that limit current flow or set voltage level in a circuit. They obey ohm's law.
V=IR; I=V/R; R=V/I (ohms law)
P=IV; P=IIR; P=VV/R (power loss)
Parallel : 2 resistors -> Rt = (R1xR2)/(R1+R2)
Seires   : 2 resistors -> Rt = R1+R2

CURRENT DIVIDER = Io = Ii x R1/(R1+R2) for R1
CURRENT DIVIDER = Io = Ii x R2/(R1+R2) for R2
VOLTAGE DIVIDER = Vo = Vi x R1/(R1+R2) for R1
VOLTAGE DIVIDER = Vo = Vi x R2/(R1+R2) for R2

VOLTAGE DIVIDER DESIGN p62
----------------------
10 Percent Rule:
Select bleeder Resistance (R2) and Current (I2).
To select R1 & R2, select the R2 so that current I2 is 10% of total desired load current
to minimise unnecessary power loss.
- Compute for R2, I1 and lastly R1
- Select Standard Resistor value for R1.
- Select Standard Resistor value for 5% of R2 value.
- Recompute the I2 after selection.

MULTIPLE VOLTAGE DIVIDER
10 Percent Rule:
Select bleeder Resistance (Rn) and Current (In).
Select the Rn so that current In is 10% of total desired load current
use Kirchoff current law to compute In-1
determine the voltage drop for accross Loadn-1
compute Rn-1.
Repeat until R1 is computed.

NOTE
----
Loads powered by voltage dividers may experience a change in voltage due to the 
following reason
+ Load resistance may suddenly change,
+ Supply voltage may vary
** Voltage divider is not recommended for application that require steady voltage Supply
** Voltage regulator (IC) is recommended for such case.

Voltage source always have a resistor in series to it.
Current source always have a resistor in parallel (shunt) to it.


BATTERY
-------
+ It is a dc source that provides constant voltage but reduces over time due to load.
+ It can be connected in parallel and in series in circuits.
SERIES
Final voltage is sum of all battery voltage
Drains quicker.
PARALLEL
Final voltage is same as one of the batterys (all battery should be of same voltage)
last longer.


SHORT CIRCUITS
+ causes excessive current flow
+ caused by wire-crossing, insulation failure, solder splatter linking conductors
-    in a circuit board.
+ Leads to component overheating, burning, open circuit.
+ Protection: Fuse, circuit breaker.
-             They placed in circuits at the end of all load leading back to voltage
-             source


OPEN CIRCUITS
+ Break in the circuit.
+ caused by wire seperation from component maybe due to burn out (fuse)
