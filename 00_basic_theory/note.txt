| Volt |
+------+
It is an electromotive force EMF between two points required to cause one 
ampere of current to do one joule (measure of energy) of work in flowing 
between the points. Voltage can also be expressed as joules per coulomb.
Vab = Uab/q = (Ub-Ua)/dq = (joules/coulomb) = energy
1v = 1j/1c


+-------+
| POWER |
+-------+
This represents how much energy per second goes into powering a ciruit.
power, p = dW/dt. (W = v*q)
p = dW/dt = v * dq/dt (dq/dt = I)
P = VI. (j/s = Watt = VA)
P = VI = (1.5V)(0.1A) = 0.15W
P = VI = IR * I = V * V/R


+-----------------------+
| RESISTANCE - ELECTRIC |
+-----------------------+
The ratio of applied voltage to the resultant current flow 
1. R = V/I
   1 ohm = 1V/1A

2. R = pL/A (resistivity x wire Length / wire cross section area)
   p = RA/L (resitivity) (ohmM)

3. G = 1/p  (conductivity -> The inverse of resitivity) (1/ohmM)
   V = IR = I * pL/A = I * L/(GA)

4. Resistivity is temperature dependent and varies based on material
   p = p0[1 + a(T-T0)]
   p  -> caluculated resistivity
   p0 -> set reference resistivity
   a  -> temperature coefficient of resistivity (1/Celscius)
   T0 -> Set reference temperature
   T  -> target temperature

The resisitivity of most metals increases with temperature because
thermal energy causes atomic vibration which reduces the drift
velocity of conducting electrons.

+----------------------+
| RESISTANCE - THERMAL |
+----------------------+
Thermal Resistance and conductivity
Tr = L/(kA)  = yL/A 
Ph = dQ/dt = k(A/L)dT = (A/L * 1/y)dT = dT/Tr

Tr : Thermal Resistance
L  : length
A  : surface area 
y  : thermal resistivity  (mC/W)
k  : thermal conductivity (W/mC)
dQ : heat difference over time
dT : Temperature difference (C)
Ph : Power as heat (W)

| CIRCUITS |
+----------+
Circuit is any arrangement of electronic components with a voltage source which drives
current within it.
They are classified as basic, series and parallel circuit.
A circuit can be a combination of both series and parallel arrangement.
         |  SERIES |  PARALLEL  | 
---------+---------+------------
Current  | same    |   divided  |
Voltage  | divided |   same     |

| RESISTOR |
+----------+
Device that limit current flow or set voltage level in a circuit. They obey ohm's law.
V=IR; I=V/R; R=V/I (ohms law)
P=IV; P=IIR; P=VV/R (power loss)
Parallel : 2 resistors -> Rt = (R1xR2)/(R1+R2)
Seires   : 2 resistors -> Rt = R1+R2

CURRENT DIVIDER = Io = Ii x R2/(R1+R2) for R1
CURRENT DIVIDER = Io = Ii x R1/(R1+R2) for R2
VOLTAGE DIVIDER = Vo = Vi x R1/(R1+R2) for R1
VOLTAGE DIVIDER = Vo = Vi x R2/(R1+R2) for R2

VOLTAGE DIVIDER DESIGN p62
----------------------
10 Percent Rule:
Select bleeder Resistance (R2) and Current (I2).
To select R1 & R2, select the R2 so that current I2 is 10% of total desired load current
to minimise unnecessary power loss.
- Compute for R2, I1 and lastly R1
- Select Standard Resistor value for R1.
- Select Standard Resistor value for 5% of R2 value.
- Recompute the I2 after selection.

MULTIPLE VOLTAGE DIVIDER
10 Percent Rule:
Select bleeder Resistance (Rn) and Current (In).
Select the Rn so that current In is 10% of total desired load current
use Kirchoff current law to compute In-1
determine the voltage drop for accross Loadn-1
compute Rn-1.
Repeat until R1 is computed.

NOTE
----
Loads powered by voltage dividers may experience a change in voltage due to the 
following reason
+ Load resistance may suddenly change,
+ Supply voltage may vary
** Voltage divider is not recommended for application that require steady voltage Supply
** Voltage regulator (IC) is recommended for such case.

Voltage source always have a resistor in series to it.
Current source always have a resistor in parallel (shunt) to it.


BATTERY
-------
+ It is a dc source that provides constant voltage but reduces over time due to load.
+ It can be connected in parallel and in series in circuits.
SERIES
Final voltage is sum of all battery voltage
Drains quicker.
PARALLEL
Final voltage is same as one of the batterys (all battery should be of same voltage)
last longer.


SHORT CIRCUITS

-    in a circuit board.
+ Leads to component overheating, burning, open circuit.
+ Protection: Fuse, circuit breaker.
-             They placed in circuits at the end of all load leading back to voltage
-             source

| SUPERPOSITION THEOREM p74 |
+---------------------------+
This concepts builds upon the kirchoffs law and ohms laws without solving too many
equations to analye a circuit by applying tricks of Thevenin and Norton to reduce
the many system of equations to just a single equation.

*** LAW ***
The current in a branch of a linear circuit is equal to the sum of the currents
produced by each source, with the other sources set equal to zero.
-----------

*** NOTE ***
+ It applies only to linear circuit. Hence cannot be applied to non-linear.
+ Source can be Voltage or current source.
+ Setting a voltage source to zero means short circuiting (replace it with wire)
+ Setting a current source to zero means open (break the link - no current flow)
+ See

+++ THEVENIN THEOREM +++
------------------------
In a complex linear circuit. Any two points (terminal) of interest can be represented
by a voltage source in series a resistor which represents the rest of the circuit
components (black box), Such circuit is called the Thevenin equivalent circuit.

+ Voltage source is called the Thevenin Voltage Vthev. Also the voltage across the 
- black box.

+ Resisance is called the Thevenin resistance Rthev. Also the resistance across the
- terminal of the blackbox, when all the DC sources are replaced with short.

+ Ohm's law can be used for the analysis.

+++ USAGE +++
-------------
+ To find the current and voltage accross a resistor (component) in a complex circuit
+ 1. Remove the resistor to form an open circuit state to act like two terminals.
-    This makes a black box.

+ 2. Determine the Thevenin Voltage using ohms law or voltage divider equation.
-    This is the voltage across the open terminal created in step 1.

+ 3. Calculate the Thevenin resistance Rthev across the open terminal created by step
-    1 and replace All the DC sources with a short (replace battery with wire)

+ 4. Build the Thevenin equivalent circuit as Vthev in series with Rthev and close
-    the ciruit by placing the resistor of interest from step.1.

+ 5. Now compute the voltage across and current through the load (resistor or interest)
-    This can done using ohms laws and voltage divider equations.



+++ NORTON THEOREM +++
----------------------
This theorem is similar to Thevenin's theorem.
Differences
-----------
+ current source in parallel with a resistance (Rthev). from step 4.

+++ USAGE +++
-------------
+ To find the current and voltage accross a resistor (component) in a complex circuit
+ 1. Remove the resistor (component of interest) and replace it with a wire (short)
+ 2. Find the short ciruit current. Note that no current flow in component parallel
-    to the created short. Therefore, it can be ignored in the computation.

+ 3. Find the Thevenin Resistance exactly as done in step 3. Note that the wire
-    added is now considered as open.

+ 4. Build the Norton equivalent circuit by
- -  Place the Rthev resistance in parallel with the computed Norton current.
- -  Extend the parallel links and enclose the circuit with the resistor of interest

+ 5. Now compute the voltage across and current through the load (resistor or interest)
-    This can done using ohms laws and current divider equations.

+++ NOTE +++
------------
+ The Thevenin circuit can be converted to Norton circuit and vice-versa.
+ T -> N : Simply place the thevenin reisistance in parallel to the current source.
+ N -> T : Simply place the thevenin reisistance in series to the voltage source.
+ Thevenin equivalent source is the nonload voltage across the resistor in the 
- norton equivalent circuit.

+ The Current of the Norton equivalent source is the short-circuit current provided
- by the Thevenin equivalent.

+ The use of Norton or Thevenin concept should apply to a complex circuit starting
- from the voltage or current source to simply the circuit progressively towards the
- the load of interest. 
- It is better this way than to try to find the thevenin or norton equivalent circuit
- all at once.

| AC CIRCUITS - p80 |
+-------------------+
Circuits powered with periodic reversed Voltage polarity and accompanied with direction
change of current periodically as well.
The actual voltage of AC circuit varies in time forming a sinusoidal waveform which
is measured from the 0v reference point.

+++ HOW TO CREATE AC VOLTAGE +++
--------------------------------
+ A simple generator can generate sinusoidal waves by rotating loops of wire coils in an
- axis between the North and South poles of Magnets.

+ DC powered oscillator circuit with inductor and capacitor by resonance.

V = Vo * Sin (theta); 
dtheta/time = w (omega) = 2pi*f = angular velocity;
ö = A.B cos(theta) = (magnetic flux)
    A -> Area of loop
    B -> Magnetic field

V = dö/dt = N* A*Bwsin(wt) = induced voltage.
I = V/R =  N * (ABw/R) * sin(wt) = induced current.

CHARGING & DISCHARGING CAPACITOR p135(105)
------------------------------------------
Capacitor can charge up and discharge almost instantaneously. This charge rate is 
controlled by resistance in capacitor or external resistor in circuit.
This feature is useful to create timer for ICs.

CHARGING
--------
I  = (Vs/R) * e^(-t/RC)   -> (t/RC)=-ln(IR/Vs)
Vr = IR = Vs * e^(-t/RC)  -> (t/RC)=-ln(Vr/Vs)
Vc = (1/C) * integral(I * dt) = Vs(1 - e^(-t/RC)) -> (t/RC)=-ln((Vs-Vc)/Vs)
tau = RC (time constant)
